                            <li>This mapping is questionable because the two colors contrast which highlights the majority of blue on the image. This may be a biased graphic as most politically affilliated things are biased.</li>

                                <li>This is a good mapping because continuous so it works well on the x-axis to show relationship between the other axis</li>

                                <li>This is a good mapping because it's clearly shows how this attribute relates to the scoring value of a batted ball</li>

                            <li>Represents the scoring value of a batted ball. More orange points indicates a well hit ball while more purple indicates balls that did not result in scores.</li>
                            <li>This is a good mapping because it very clearly shows where the sweet spot is to optimize scoring value as a function of batted ball exit velocity and launch angle.</li>

                        <li>This is a good choice of color map as the categorical data can easily be differetiated since the hues are very different</li>
